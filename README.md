# WarmApp Project

Advanced Software Engineering Class

Version: 1.0 

Team: Amir Hossein - Pietro Bonazzi - Adam Herman - Faisal Alsayed 

------------------------------
# Overview 

WarmApp is an initiative we as an avid sportsman took to support the sports community with the aim to merge technology for a better use and outcomes during this challenging period the society is going through. The idea is coughing our attentions when we realized the impact caused by the pandemic on soccer practice and sport socializing events. In the interest of supporting the sports community, closing the social gap between athletes and recovering a severely damaged society that has suffered social distancing for more than a year, we decided to develop an app that allows soccer players within a detected region to socialize, to form a team and play soccer. 

We intended to create the application on the basis of the socializing fundamentals, allowing users to create their profiles indicting their demographical information and their soccer skills which they wish to promote. What is unique about the idea is that we are using the geo-location services to engorge regional connectivity and sport socializing events by enabling location dedications for players and active matches so user can explore and be active a participant in nearby events. Such future would be a contributing factor to promote a healthy lifestyle, reducing mental challenging some people may face due to the pandemic general environment, and enhance confidence in young players by allowing them to shine out in a friendly and encouraging settings.

# Pull Requests Handling 

  The developemnt of the project was defined based on two catagories, backed-end and front-end. Each catagory is addressed to go through a workflow from the developers to the master for approval. Each catagory will then will be devided into sub-catagoires whihc will then follow the workflow up to the master. 
  
    
    (a) Developer Submit Pull Request of the Completed Task 
    (b) Master Review Submitted Code Before Merge 
    (c) Master Merge Submitted Code into a Validation Branch 
    (d) Master Validate Functionality 
    (e) Master Merge into Main
